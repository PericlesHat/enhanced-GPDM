# Coming Soon...
We present modified Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (mGPDM), a Bayesian method used for capturing high-dimension data's dynamics and transfer learning ability.

This repo is the official implementation of Long-term Li-ion Battery Degradation Forecasting Using an Enhanced Gaussian Process Dynamical Model and Knowledge Transfer. Our code is based on PyTorch with CUDA supported.
